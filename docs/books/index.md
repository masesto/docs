# Linux Books

You've found the **Books** section of the documentation. This is where longer-form documentation is kept. These documents are broken down into sections or "chapters" to make it easy for you to work through them at your own pace and keep track of your progress. These documents were created by people just like you, with a passion for certain subjects.
