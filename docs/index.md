# Linux Documentation

## Welcome!

Welcome to the Linux Documentation & Tutorials; we are glad you're here. Here you will find documents on how to build Linux itself, as well as documents on various subjects that are important to the Linux community.

This home page will give you an introduction to the documentation website and how to find your way around â€” we're confident that you will feel right at home.

## Navigating the Site

### Getting Around

Now, you are on the home page of the documentation. If you glance at the top menu (which is always available, including on mobile devices) you can see the main structure showing the top-level sections of the documentation site. If you click on each top menu item (try 'Guides' for example) then on the left side, you will see the list of *sub-sections* for each main section. Guides has many topics of interest.

When you open a document, on the right side you will see a 'Table of contents' with clickable navigation links for that document (for mobile devices try landscape orientation). For long documents the table of contents allows you to move around the document with ease. If you are reading a long document and want to go back to the top press <kbd>pg up</kbd> and you will see a <kbd>Back to top</kbd> button appear at the top of the screen.

The main sections of the documentation site are:

* **Guides**: which cover specific ways to set up and use Linux.
* **Books**: are more detailed information based around a specific area.
* **Labs**: it is 'back to school', but these tutorials you will enjoy doing!


### Using Search

If you want to quickly find specific information or documents, the documentation site has full-text search capability. Start typing in the 'Search' entry field in the top menu bar and the site will return drill down search results.

To open a page in the search results click (or tap on mobile) on the desired page in the list displayed.
