## Prerequisites

GLPI is a Web application that will need:

* a webserver;
* PHP;
* a database.

## Web server

GLPI requires a web server that supports PHP, like:

* Apache 2 (or more recent);
* Nginx;
* lighttpd;
* Microsoft IIS.


## Installing GLPI on Ubuntu 22.04

We will cover the steps of installing GLPI on Ubuntu LTS in the remaining sections. Before you can follow this guide along, you need to have a fresh installation of Ubuntu and user account with sudo privileges.

## Step 1: Update Ubuntu

As usual, ensure your packages list is up to date.

```

$ sudo apt update

```

You can also upgrade installed packages by running the following command.

```

$ sudo apt -y upgrade

```

## Step 2: Install MariaDB database server

GLPI requires a relational database to store its data. Let’s install MariaDB on Ubuntu Linux system by running the following commands:

```

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install mariadb-server
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation

```

Create a database and user for GLPI.

```
$ sudo mysql -u root -p

CREATE DATABASE glpi;
CREATE USER 'glpi'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongDBPassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON glpi.* TO 'glpi'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

```

## Step 3: Install PHP and Apache

We need to have Apache web server and PHP installed for GLPI to run and be accessed from a web interface.

```

$ sudo apt -y install php php-{curl,zip,bz2,gd,imagick,intl,apcu,memcache,imap,mysql,cas,ldap,tidy,pear,xmlrpc,pspell,mbstring,json,iconv,xml,gd,xsl}

```

Then install Apache and its PHP module.

```

$ sudo apt -y install apache2 libapache2-mod-php

```

Add the httpOnly flag to the cookie:

```

$ sudo vim /etc/php/*/apache2/php.ini
session.cookie_httponly = on

```

## Step 4: Download and Install GLPI

Download the latest stable release of GLPI. It follows a semantic versioning scheme, on 3 digits, where the first one is the **major release**, the second the **minor** and the third the **fix** release.

Check for the latest stable release on the [Downloads](https://glpi-project.org/downloads/) page. As of this wirting, this is 10.0.10.

```

$ sudo apt-get -y install wget curl
$ VER=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/glpi-project/glpi/releases/latest|grep tag_name|cut -d '"' -f 4)
$ wget https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/download/$VER/glpi-$VER.tgz

```

Uncompress the downloaded the archive:

```

$ tar xvf glpi-$VER.tgz

```

Move the created **glpi** folder to the **/var/www/html** directory.

```

$ sudo mv glpi /var/www/html/

```

Give Apache user ownership of the directory:

```

$ sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/

```

## Step 5: Finish GLPI installation

Visit your server IP or hostname URL on **/glpi**. If it is your local machine, you can use: http://Server_IP/glpi

On the first page, Select your language.

You should get the login page.

![image](images/install-glpi-ubuntu-18.04-08.png)

Default logins / passwords are:

- **glpi**/**glpi** for the administrator account
- **tech**/**tech** for the technician account
- **normal**/**normal** for the normal account
- **post-only**/**postonly** for the postonly account

On first login, you’re asked to change the password. Please set new password before configuring GLPI. This is done under **Administration > Users**.

This marks the end of installing GLPI on Ubuntu 22.04. The next sections are about adding assets and other IT Management stuff for your infrastructure/environment. For this, please refer to the [official GLPI documentation](https://glpi-project.org/resources/#documentation)

## Apache configuration

Here is a virtual host configuration example for **Apache 2** web server.

!!! Warning
    The following configuration is only suitable for GLPI version 10.0.7 or later.

```

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName glpi.localhost

    DocumentRoot /var/www/glpi/public

    # If you want to place GLPI in a subfolder of your site (e.g. your virtual host is serving multiple applications),
    # you can use an Alias directive. If you do this, the DocumentRoot directive MUST NOT target the GLPI directory itself.
    # Alias "/glpi" "/var/www/glpi/public"

    <Directory /var/www/glpi/public>
        Require all granted

        RewriteEngine On

        # Redirect all requests to GLPI router, unless file exists.
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

```

!!! Note
    If you cannot change the **Apache** configuration (e.g. you are using a shared hosting), you can use a **.htaccess** file.


```

# /var/www/glpi/.htaccess
RewriteBase /
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/public
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/index.php [QSA,L]

```
